7. Based on the sample 3 processes, the Round Robin algorithm runs better. I also tried it with:

- Few processes, short bursts: The FCFS is faster if the quantum for RR is greater than the highest burst time. Otherwise they are equal.
- Few processes, long bursts:
- Many processes, short bursts:
- Many processes, long bursts:
- Many processes, one with long, others with short:
